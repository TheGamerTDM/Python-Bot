Python-Bot
This is a discord bot that was made with python

What you need: You need jdk. I used jdk-13.0.2. You can use newer if you'r lavalink needs it.

Lavalink: https://ci.fredboat.com/viewLog.html?buildId=lastSuccessful&buildTypeId=Lavalink_Build&tab=artifacts&guest=1

OpenJDK: https://jdk.java.net/archive/

What to do. Download both files and unzip them to your 'BOT' folder. Then put the lavalink in to you're jdk folder as you can see below.

C:\Users\[UserName]\Desktop\Python-Bot\jdk-13.0.2\bin

Then do the same with application.yml in the same folder as lavalink. Then start up CMD. You have to cd in to the same folder as lavalink and type java -jar Lavalink.jar
