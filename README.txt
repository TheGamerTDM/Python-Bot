# Python-Bot
 This is a discord bot hat was made with python

So what you need is: You need jdk. I usede jdk-13.0.2 you can use newer if you lavalink needs it

Lavalink: https://ci.fredboat.com/viewLog.html?buildId=lastSuccessful&buildTypeId=Lavalink_Build&tab=artifacts&guest=1

OpenJDK: https://jdk.java.net/archive/

So what you do is you download both and then unzip both files to your discord bot then you going to put lavalink in C:\Users\[UserName]\Desktop\discord-music-master\jdk-13.0.2\bin
mostly you have to put it in the jdk-13.0.2\bin folder with application.yml then start cmd up and run lavalink then run your bot:D
